What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized a .git file is created. In order to use git commands
within the files contained in the directory is necessary to have a .git file within the directory.
Also, it will not have any commits saved, since you will have to do that manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging are serves as an intermediary between all the files in the directory and the ones
you wish to commit.  It serves as an extra stepping stone in the commit process so the user
can verify if those are really the files he/she wishes to commit.
